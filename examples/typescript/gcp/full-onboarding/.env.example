# false (default, recommended for production):
#   - CAST AI nodes remain running after 'pulumi destroy'
#   - Workloads continue without disruption
#   - Allows reconnecting CAST AI later
#   - Requires manual node deletion before cluster deletion
#   - Safer - prevents accidental node deletion
#
# true (recommended for test/dev):
#   - CAST AI nodes automatically deleted during 'pulumi destroy'
#   - Cluster can be deleted immediately afterward
#   - Clean automatic cleanup
#   - May disrupt workloads on CAST AI nodes
